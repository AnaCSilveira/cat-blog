              Cats are fascinating animals and surrounded by mysteries. In
              independent and mysterious temperament, these felines are known
              for their agility, elegance and behavior many sometimes
              unpredictable. However, recently, a theory has gained space on the
              internet and among conspiracy theorists: these would be the
              astronaut cats?
            </p>
            <p>
              The theory suggests that cats are not land animals, but rather
              extraterrestrial beings sent to carry out a specific mission on
              our planet. There are historical reports that point to the fact
              that that cats were considered sacred beings in different cultures
              and even associated with divine figures. that could indicate that
              cats have a much more mystical origin than previously thought.
            </p>
            <p>
              Furthermore, there are theorists who believe that felines have
              telepathic abilities and are able to communicate with others alien
              species. This belief is based on reports from people who claim to
              have seen cats reacting to stimuli that are not perceptible to
              human beings, or even behaving differently unusual way during
              astronomical events, such as an aurora boreal. These and other
              signs were interpreted as signs of that cats would be
              interplanetary beings.
